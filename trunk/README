RELEASE NOTES

Release Notes for Gloss 0.1.0
-------------------------------

* First major release. Should be considered a developers version only as it requires significant testing. However:

  * All modules included with 0.1 have been tested to work on a standard, unaltered MythTV 0.21 setup. This does not mean, however,
    that they will work on *your* MythTV 0.21 system. 

  * Live TV playback is dependant on gstreamers ability to play whatever format your video is capture in. This is
    known to work at least with DVB-T mpeg2-ts broadcasts
