= Introduction =

This page will give a very brief overview on how to get Gloss up and running on your system. It assumes you already have a working MythTV setup using a version 0.21 backend.

Note: If using Clutter 0.4.x please use SVN rev. 86 as anything past this has been updated for Clutter 0.6

= Ubuntu =
Gloss was developed on Ubuntu so hence I can give the best instructions for how to get it working on this platform.

== Getting Clutter ==
 There are currently two main methods for obtaining Clutter, which is required by Gloss. The first is using the prebuilt binaries and is relatively straightforward. This is currently the recommended method as Gloss is being developed against the Clutter 0.6 release. The second method is compiling from source (releases or SVN) however use of Clutter SVN with Gloss is currently untested. In each case, simply copy the lines into the command prompt, one at a time. 

=== Binaries (apt-get) ===
  # If you're using Ubuntu Hardy, then you don't need to add anything, but if you have an earlier version you will need the add the Clutter repository: `echo "deb http://debian.o-hand.com gutsy/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list` (Replace gutsy with edgy/dapper/fiesty if required)
  # `sudo apt-get update`
  # `sudo apt-get install libclutter-0.6-0 libclutter-gst-0.6-0 libclutter-cairo-0.6-0 python-clutter python-mysqldb python-gst0.10 subversion eyed3 gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mpegdemux jackd  gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly`
