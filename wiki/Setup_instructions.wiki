= Introduction =

This page will give a very brief overview on how to get Gloss up and running on your system. It assumes you already have a working MythTV setup.

Note: If using Clutter 0.4.x please use SVN rev. 86 as anything past this has been updated for Clutter 0.6

= Ubuntu =

Gloss was developed on Ubuntu so hence I can give the best instructions for how to get it working on this platform. Simply copy the following lines into the command prompt, one at a time. 

  # `echo "deb http://debian.o-hand.com feisty/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list` (Replace fiesty with edgy / dapper if required)
  # `sudo apt-get update`
  # `sudo apt-get install libclutter-0.4-0 libclutter-gst-0.4-0 python-clutter python-mysqldb subversion eyed3 gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mpegdemux jackd`
  # `svn checkout http://gloss-mc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gloss-mc`
  # `cd gloss-mc`
  # `python gloss.py`


= SVN = 

Using the SVN of Clutter is HIGHLY recommended as it is required for all newer versions of Gloss.
The following instructions are a rough guide for Ubuntu Gutsy

  # 'sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev gtk-doc-tools gcc libpango1.0-dev libsdl-pango-dev python automake1.9 subversion gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mpegdemux jackd python-mysqldb python-dev python-gtk2-dev python-gobject-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev python-gobject-doc'
  # 'svn co http://svn.o-hand.com/repos/clutter/trunk clutter'
  # cd clutter/clutter
  # ./autogen.sh
  # sudo make install
  # cd ../clutter-gst
  # ./autogen.sh
  # sudo make install
  # cd ../bindings/pyclutter
  # ./autogen.sh
  # sudo make install
