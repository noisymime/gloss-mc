This page will give a very brief overview on how to get Gloss up and running on your system. It assumes you already have a working MythTV setup.


= Ubuntu =

Gloss was developed on Ubuntu so hence I can give the best instructions for how to get it working on this platform. Simply copy the following lines into the command prompt, one at a time. 

  # `echo "deb http://debian.o-hand.com feisty/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list` (Replace fiesty with edgy / dapper if required)
  # `sudo apt-get update`
  # `sudo apt-get install libclutter-0.4-0 libclutter-gst-0.4-0 python-clutter python-mysqldb subversion eyed3 gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mpegdemux`
  # `svn checkout http://gloss-mc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gloss-mc`
  # `cd gloss-mc`
  # `python gloss.py`
